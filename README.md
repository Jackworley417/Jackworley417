 Hi, I’m @Jackworley417
With nmy life as a Dev Ops Engineer, I'm constantly looking for way to improve my skills and how to automate things.
In working with HTML, Javascript, Python, SQL, KQL, and various libraries I've been able to come up with different tools and apps that might be helpful.
Over the next few weeks and months I hope to move all my projects over to Github so others can see.
I’m looking to collaborate on any project
